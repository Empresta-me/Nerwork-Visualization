# Network-Visualization

## Used to display the user's network of trustiness in the form of an interactive graph, with D3.js

### plan: 
	- each node is another user
	- clicking on any node shows their level of trustiness (in this network) 
	- the link between two users is red if either of them doesn't trust the other, green otherwise
