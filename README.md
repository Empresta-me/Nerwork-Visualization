# Network-Visualization

## Used to display the user's network of trustiness in the form of an interactive graph, with D3.js

	- each node is another user
	- clicking on any node shows their level of trustiness (in this network) 
	- the link between two users is red if either of them doesn't trust the other, green otherwise



### current problems

clicking on a node makes a tooltip with info appear, but its messing with the draggable feature (working on it)
